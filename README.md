# web-widgets
A collection of JavaScript objects for creating a web page interface widgets in the LCARS style.

This is in an early phase so far, but I am experimenting with create a wiki documentation page in Google Docs using [You need a wiki](https://youneedawiki.com).
The documentation for this project is here: [Web Widgets Wiki](https://youneedawiki.com/app/page/1BcJDjdNk9Un-K57R-DmUFWOcxR4w_Rh_Owy9meaRJRw?p=1kE0ID3TOkoSepjGj9coDhDs374bVfjZh).

## Description

This project works in tandem with the [LCARS Template Project](https://github.com/steven-lyles/LCARS-template) that is an [LCARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCARS) based web interface. These widgets are done in the LCARS style and are meant to be components of that interface.

<span style="color: red;"><b>This is work in progress.</b></span> There is still much work to be done, but you can preview a live demo online of the progress so far at: [Web-Widgets](https://www.stevenlyles.net/playground/web_widgets/)

Working so far:
- Nav Arrows (Vertical & Horizontal)
- Indicators (Vertical & Horizontal)
- Position Increment (Vertical & Horizontal)
- Now (Time-Date Widget)
- Logo
- Horizontal Bars Divider
- Subject Divider
- Button Group
- Button Stack
- Button List

## Demo vs Example
In the source you will find a "demo" folder and a "usage" folder - a clarification is in order. Both of these folders contain html files showing how to use the various widgets. Usage are bare-bones usage demonstrating only what is needed to create and use a widget. Demos go further and show the widget used in a more real context with other UI elements.

All demo and example pages will start with the prefixes "demo_" and "example_" respectively.
