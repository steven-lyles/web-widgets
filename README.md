# web-widgets
A collection of JavaScript objects for easily creating web page interface widgets.

## Description

This project is the results of another project (not yet in GitHub) that is an [LCARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCARS) based web interface. These widgets are done in the LCARS style and meant to be components of that interface.

This is work in progress. Some of the code submitted still needs refactoring and there is more code to add.
