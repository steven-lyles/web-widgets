# web-widgets
A collection of JavaScript objects for easily creating web page interface widgets.

## Description

This project is the results of another project (not yet in GitHub) that is an [LCARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCARS) based web interface. These widgets are done in the LCARS style and are meant to be components of that interface.

This is work in progress. There is still much work to be done, but you can preview a live demo online of the progress so far at: [Web-Widgets](https://www.stevenlyles.net/playground/web_widgets/)
