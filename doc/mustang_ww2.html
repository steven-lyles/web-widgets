    One of the most famous missions of the P-51 Mustang was the bombing of the German oil industry,
    which was a critical component of the German war effort. The Mustang's long range and speed
    allowed it to fly deep into Germany and attack these targets with relative impunity. This
    mission had a significant impact on the outcome of the war and is considered one of the most
    successful bombing campaigns of World War II.
