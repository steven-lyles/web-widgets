**Step 1:** Require the web-widgets object.
```angular2html
<script type="text/javascript" src=".web_widget_indicator.js"></script>
```
**Step 2:** Create a container with a unique id that will be passed to the widget constructor.
```angular2html
<div id='indicator-container'></div>
```
**NOTE:**  If this container is within a parent container, make sure the parent is large enough to hold it.
