    In summary, the North American P-51 Mustang was an iconic aircraft of the World War II and the
    Korean War, and it played a key role in escorting Allied bombers on long-range missions over
    Germany and also used as a fighter-bomber and reconnaissance aircraft. Its exceptional range,
    speed and maneuverability made it one of the most successful fighters of World War II, and it
    remained in service until the 1980s. The Mustang is still considered one of the greatest
    fighters of all time, and continues to be celebrated and admired by aviation enthusiasts
    around the world.
