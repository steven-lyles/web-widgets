## Introduction

**Web Widgets** are a collection of reusable GUI objects built as Javascript classes based on the ES6 standard.

They can be incorporated into a web page with three steps. Use the indicator web widget to the left to see the steps used to create it.

Click on the up/down arrows to increment through pages or click on a indicator directly to jump to that page.
