    The P-51 Mustang was widely used by various air forces around the world after the end of World War
    II and served in various conflicts, including the Korean War. It remained in service with various
    air forces until the 1980s, and it is widely considered to be one of the greatest fighters of
    World War II. Even today, the P-51 Mustang remains a popular aircraft among aviation enthusiasts,
    and many are still flown in airshows and other events.
